Abstract
========

This REP describes the variants for the ROS Bouncy release and for releases that follow until otherwise replaced by a similar update REP.


Motivation
==========

For a discussion on the general motivation and role of variants,
please see REP 108 [1]_.

This document covers the common variants used for recommended
installations.
It is expressed in the ros2/variants repository on github.com [2]_.

The definitions in this REP are concise for clearer purpose, and do not list all transitive dependencies explicitly.


Specification
=============

End-user entry points
---------------------

We define three main entry points for ROS users.

 * desktop (recommended)
 * ros_base
 * ros_core

Variants
--------

ROS Core
''''''''

The `ros_core` variants composes the core communication protocols.
It may not contain any GUI dependencies.

::

 - ros_core:
      packages: [ament_cmake, ament_cmake_ros, ament_index, ament_lint,
                 ament_package, class_loader, common_interfaces, launch,
                 pluginlib, rcl, rclcpp, rclpy, rcutils, rmw, ros2cli,
                 ros_environment]


ROS Base
''''''''

The `ros_base` metapackage composes the `ros_core` metapackage with
commonly used libraries.
It may not contain any GUI dependencies.

::

  - ros_base:
      extends: [ros_core]
      packages: [geometry2, robot_state_publisher, urdf]


Desktop variants
''''''''''''''''

The `desktop` metapackage is the main entry point for users.
It provides all commonly used libraries as well as visualization tools and tutorials.

::

  - desktop:
      extends: [ros_base]
      packages: [angles, cartographer_ros, demos, depthimage_to_laserscan,
                 examples, joystick_drivers, navigation, ros_astra_camera,
                 rviz, sros2, teleop_twist_joy, teleop_twist_keyboard,
                 vision_opencv]


Institution-specific and robot-specific
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Please see REP 108 [1]_ for discussion of institution-specific
metapackages.

When creating robot or institution specific metapackages consider
using the \*_robot and \*_desktop and \*_base form where * is the
institution or robot name.

An institution is not required to provide a metapackage, they are
mainly provided for convenience and identity.
